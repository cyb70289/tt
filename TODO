- 32-bits(binary) or 9-digits(decimal)
  * 32-bits is much more efficient than 9-digits in calculation
  * pitfalls of 32-digits:
    - alignment in adding
    - alignment in rounding
    - conversion between binary and decimal
- makefile: LDLIBS should be set along with each binary
- apn_to_float: long double to double conversion may result to wrong result
- _tt_is_zero()
- tt_stack, tt_queue: only ensures 8-bytes alignment
- select, rank
